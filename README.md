# Automattic-Tracks-Android
Client library for tracking user events for later analysis

## Introduction

Tracks for Android is a client library used to help track events inside of
an application. This project solely is responsible for collecting the events,
storing them locally, and on a schedule send them out to the Automattic
servers. Realistically this library is only useful for Automattic-based
projects but the idea is to share what we've made.
